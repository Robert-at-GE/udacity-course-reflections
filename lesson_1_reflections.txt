How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	The changes identified exactly where the problem was introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	It reduces worry about going too fast by making undo possible.
	It provides the information about when and why various changes were introduced.
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	It allows you to make logical change grouping that can be understood.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	It is tradeoff.  Simplicity  vs. Necessity.
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	git log tells the history with commit IDs
	git diff tells differences between any to commits.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	Exactly.
