What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  - Git creates a .git directory in your current directory.
  - Git does NOT make any commits automatically at this point.
  If you do "git status" it shows all the files that exist there as "Untracked".
  You would need to "git add .." and "git commit" the files you want to put under version control.
