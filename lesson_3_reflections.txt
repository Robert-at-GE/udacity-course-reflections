When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - When you will be colaborating with others
 - When you will be using multiple sites / terminals to access and modify the source content
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  - Because you are working on something and do not want some asynchronous update (due to someone updating the remote) to change your files and break your build before you are ready for merging!
